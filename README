SQLiteView -- lightweight GTK-based (GTK 3) database browser
============================================================

A compact visual tool to inspect and edit SQLite database files.

The interface is built with GTK 3 and provides a simple,
spreadsheet-like view of tables and rows for quick browsing and light
editing.  Designed for users and developers who prefer a graphical view
over ad-hoc SQL for routine inspection and small edits.

Key current features
--------------------

  - **GTK3-based UI.**  Main window with a list of tables and a rows
    view (both `GtkTreeView`).
  - **Open/close database.**  Detect and open SQLite files, keeping
    a `sqlite3` handle in the shared application context.
  - **Table list.**  Populates a GtkListStore with table names
    (excluding internal `sqlite_*` tables), ordered alphabetically.
  - **Row browsing.**  Create a `GtkListStore` for a selected table with
    string columns and load up to specific number of rows into the rows
    view.
  - **In-place text edits.**  Apply textual updates to cells by issuing
    `UPDATE` statements (`rowid` column is read-only).
  - **Context management.**  Shared context struct holds the database
    handle, main window, views, current table/column metadata, and
    helper functions to free column metadata.

Planned for future versions (not yet implemented)
-------------------------------------------------

  - Create/modify table schema or indexes from the UI.
  - Import/export tables or rows (CSV/SQL dump).
  - Advanced search, filtering, or arbitrary ad-hoc query editor with
    result panes.
  - Transactional batch edits, undo/redo, or change log viewer.

Limitations and notes
---------------------

Current version is still in development: **version 0.1.0** (beta):
  - Row load capped at 100 rows (`SQL_QUERY_MAX_LIMIT`), just for now.
  - Column values are handled as strings in the list store; no typed
    editors or complex cell widgets are present.
  - The code assumes a single open database stored in the context and
    requires explicit calls to populate views and manage column
    metadata.
